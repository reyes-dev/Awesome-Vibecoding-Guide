## Questions

### How do I check my current tier?

Check your GitHub profile or run:
```bash
npm run contributors:status
```

### Can I skip tiers?

Tier advancement is milestone-based, not competitive. All who meet requirements advance.

### Do sponsorships affect tiers?

No. Sponsorship provides separate recognition, not tier advancement.

### What if I'm inactive for a while?

Tiers are maintained for 12 months of inactivity. After that, consider reactivation.

### Can I lose my tier?

Tiers are permanent recognition of contribution history.
