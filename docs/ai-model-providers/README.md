# AI Model Providers 🤖

A curated selection of AI model providers and services optimized for vibecoding workflows. These providers offer the intelligence and reasoning capabilities that power modern development workflows.

**Not sure which provider to choose?** Check out our comprehensive [**Provider Comparison Guide**](./choosing-your-provider.md) for budget-based recommendations, feature comparisons, and use case scenarios.

## Primary AI Providers

### My Provider Setup

I use multiple providers together for maximum effectiveness:

1. **[Synthetic.new](./synthetic-new.md)** — Primary daily driver
   - MiniMax M2.1 for fast, efficient coding
   - 20+ models including Kimi, DeepSeek, GLM
   - Privacy-first approach
   - [First month $10](https://synthetic.new/?referral=IDyp75aoQpW9YFt)

2. **[MiniMax Coding Plan](./minimax-coding-plan.md)** — Backup provider
   - Direct MiniMax subscription for focused usage
   - Competitive pricing with generous limits
   - M2.1 and M2.1-Lightning models
   - [Sign up](https://minimax.chat/)

3. **[GLM Coding Plan](./glm-coding-plan.md)** — Secondary backup
   - GLM-4.6 for reliable everyday coding
   - Excellent value for heavy usage
   - [10% discount](https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=CUEFJ9ALMX)

### Why Multiple Providers?

Synthetic.new serves as my primary provider because it offers MiniMax alongside 20+ other models in a single subscription. I keep additional providers as backups for specific scenarios:

- **Direct MiniMax subscription**: When you want focused, dedicated MiniMax access
- **GLM backup**: When you need a reliable fallback with different model characteristics
- **Model variety**: Synthetic gives you flexibility without managing multiple accounts

### Budget Guide

| Budget | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **$10-20/month** | Synthetic Standard or MiniMax Starter — excellent starting points |
| **$20-40/month** | Synthetic Pro or MiniMax Plus — for heavy usage |
| **$40-60/month** | Synthetic Pro + MiniMax — maximum flexibility |
| **$100+/month (premium)** | Claude Code Max5 — if budget isn't a constraint |

**Note:** MiniMax is available through both direct subscription and [Synthetic.new](./synthetic-new.md). Choose based on whether you want model variety or focused MiniMax access.

See the [detailed provider comparison](./choosing-your-provider.md) for comprehensive breakdown.

## Honorable Mentions
Services I've used but don't recommend for primary development work:
- **[Honorable Mentions](./honorable-mentions/README.md)** — Services with caveats, learning platforms, budget platforms, or over-expensive options
  - Includes: [Mistral AI](./honorable-mentions/mistral-ai.md), [Chutes.ai](./honorable-mentions/chutes.ai.md), [OpenRouter](./honorable-mentions/openrouter.md), and more.

These providers can be valuable for experimentation and learning, but have reliability, performance, or cost concerns (from too cheap/unreliable to prohibitively expensive) that make them unsuitable for serious professional development.

## Integration Philosophy

### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) Approach
All recommended providers support external API integration:
- **Cost Control**: Pay only for what you use
- **Provider Flexibility**: Switch between providers based on needs
- **Model Selection**: Choose optimal models for specific tasks
- **Privacy & Security**: Maintain control over your data and API keys

### Performance Optimization
Providers selected for:
- **Speed**: Fast response times for rapid development iterations
- **Quality**: High-quality code generation and reasoning
- **Reliability**: Consistent performance and availability
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Competitive pricing for development workflows

## Usage Patterns

### Development Workflow Integration
AI providers work seamlessly with the development tools stack:
- **Code Generation**: Generate boilerplate, functions, and complete implementations
- **Debugging Assistance**: Identify and fix bugs with AI-powered analysis
- **Code Review**: Get automated feedback on code quality and best practices
- **Documentation**: Generate and maintain code documentation

### Task-Specific Model Selection
Different tasks benefit from different AI models:
- **Simple Tasks**: Use cost-effective models for basic code generation
- **Complex Problems**: Leverage advanced models for challenging architectural decisions
- **Specialized Domains**: Choose models trained on specific technologies or frameworks

## Cost Management

### Optimization Strategies
- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models for task complexity
- **Token Management**: Optimize prompts to reduce API costs
- **Caching**: Store and reuse common responses
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests for efficiency

### Budget Planning
- **Free Tiers**: Leverage free offerings from various providers
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track API usage and costs across providers
- **Cost Comparison**: Compare pricing across different providers
- **Scaling Strategy**: Plan cost scaling as projects grow

## Configuration & Setup

### API Key Management
- **Security**: Store API keys securely using environment variables
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys for security
- **Backup**: Maintain backup keys for failover scenarios
- **Monitoring**: Track API usage and costs

### Provider Configuration
- **Endpoint Setup**: Configure custom endpoints for optimal performance
- **Model Parameters**: Fine-tune model settings for specific use cases
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to control costs
- **Error Handling**: Set up proper error handling and retry logic

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering
- **Clarity**: Write clear, specific prompts for better results
- **Context**: Provide relevant context about your project and requirements
- **Iteration**: Refine prompts based on results and feedback
- **Consistency**: Use consistent prompt patterns for predictable results

### Quality Assurance
- **Code Review**: Always review AI-generated code before deployment
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test AI-generated implementations
- **Security**: Validate AI-generated code for security vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Test performance of AI-generated solutions

## Troubleshooting
