# Case Studies

> Real-world examples of vibecoding success, challenges, and lessons learned.

## Purpose

Case studies demonstrate practical applications of vibecoding techniques. They provide:
- **Proof of concept** through real implementations
- **Learning opportunities** from successes and failures
- **ROI analysis** for business justification
- **Implementation patterns** you can adapt

## Case Study Types

### Success Stories

Detailed accounts of successful vibecoding projects:
- Problem solved
- Approach taken
- Results achieved
- Key learnings

### Failure Analysis

Open discussions of projects that didn't go as planned:
- What went wrong
- Root cause analysis
- Recovery strategies
- Prevention measures
