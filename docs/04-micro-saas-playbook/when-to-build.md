# When to Build

> The best Micro-SaaS opportunities come from problems you've already seen.

## Spotting Opportunities

Pay attention during client work. The signals are there.

### Signal 1: Expensive Underused Software

Client pays for software they barely use.

**Listen for:**
- "We only use 10% of this thing"
- "It's way too complicated for what we need"
- "$200/month just to book appointments"

**Examples:**
- Full CRM when they need a contact list
- Enterprise booking system for a 3-person shop
- Project management suite for simple task tracking

### Signal 2: Manual Processes

Client does something repeatedly by hand.

**Watch for:**
- Spreadsheets tracking inventory, leads, appointments
- Paper sign-in sheets, quote forms, intake forms
- Phone tag for scheduling and confirmations
- Copy-pasting between systems

**Examples:**
- Mechanic writes appointments on paper calendar
- Contractor quotes via email back-and-forth
- Salon texts each client manually for reminders

### Signal 3: Workflow Complaints

Client mentions friction in their daily work.

**Listen for:**
- "I wish there was a simple way to..."
- "Every [software name] is too complicated"
- "I spend hours every week on this"

### Signal 4: Duplicate Requests

Multiple clients mention the same pain.

This is gold. If 3 clients need simple booking:
- Build it once
- Sell it to all 3
- Still not "competing in a market" — it's upselling to known clients

## Qualifying the Opportunity

Not every pain is worth building for. Ask:

### 1. Is it costing them real money?

| Cost Type | Example | Worth Building? |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Direct | $200/month for booking software | Yes |
| Time | 5 hours/week on manual scheduling | Yes |
| Missed revenue | Losing customers to slow response | Yes |
| Minor annoyance | "I wish the button was blue" | No |

### 2. Can you build something simpler?

The key word is **simpler**, not better.

| Their Current Tool | Your Micro-SaaS | Viable? |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Calendly ($15/mo) | Basic booking | Maybe — only if they're not using Calendly features |
| Salesforce CRM | Simple contact list | Yes — massive overkill for small business |
| Custom invoicing app | Custom invoicing app | No — same complexity |

### 3. Will they actually use it?

Some clients ask for tools and never adopt them.

**Good signs:**
- They're actively complaining
- The pain is daily/weekly
- They've tried alternatives

**Bad signs:**
- They're "just curious"
- It's a nice-to-have
- Current process works fine

## The Conversation

When you spot an opportunity:

> "I noticed you're using [expensive tool] for [simple task]. I could build you a simpler version that does exactly what you need — [specific feature]. It would save you [amount] per month. Want me to put together a proposal?"

Or after observing a manual process:

> "You mentioned spending [time] on [task] every week. I could build a simple tool that handles that automatically. Most clients pay around $[range]/month for something like this. Worth exploring?"

Keep it casual. No pressure. You're solving a problem you've observed.

## Red Flags (Don't Build)

- **"Can you add this feature too?"** — Scope creep before you start
- **"Make it just like [complex software]"** — They want enterprise, not micro
- **"This would be great for other businesses too"** — They want a product, not a tool
- **"I don't really have budget"** — Pain isn't real enough
- **"Let me think about it for a few months"** — Move on
