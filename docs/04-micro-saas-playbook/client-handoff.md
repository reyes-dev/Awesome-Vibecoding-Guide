# Client Handoff

> Ship it, train them, support it. Keep the relationship healthy.

## The Handoff Process

### Step 1: Deploy to Production

Before the handoff call:
- Deployed to real URL (their domain or subdomain)
- Test data removed
- Real data populated if applicable
- Mobile tested

### Step 2: Training Session

30-60 minutes. Screen share. Walk them through.

**Agenda:**
1. Admin login (how to access)
2. Core workflow (the ONE thing)
3. Common tasks (add slot, view booking, etc.)
4. What to do if something breaks (contact you)

**Record the session.** Send them the video. They'll forget and rewatch.

### Step 3: Documentation (Minimal)

One-page doc covering:
- Login URL and credentials
- How to do 3-5 most common tasks
- Your contact info for support

Don't over-document. They won't read it. The video is enough.

### Step 4: Go Live

- Switch DNS if needed
- Send announcement to their customers (if applicable)
- Be available for first 24-48 hours (quick response)

## Support Expectations

Set these upfront. Include in your proposal/contract.

### What's Included

| Category | Examples | Response Time |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Bug fixes | Something broke | 24 hours |
| Quick questions | "How do I X?" | 24-48 hours |
| Minor tweaks | Text change, color change | 48-72 hours |

### What's Extra (Quoted Separately)

| Category | Examples | How to Handle |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| New features | "Can you add payments?" | Quote it |
| Redesign | "I want it to look different" | Quote it |
| Integration | "Connect to my CRM" | Quote it |
| Training | "Train my new employee" | Hourly or flat |

### Support Boundaries

Be clear:
> "Support covers bugs and quick questions. New features and major changes are quoted separately — I'll always give you a price before doing the work."

## Common Post-Launch Requests

### "Can you change the color?"

Included if it takes 10 minutes. Quote if it's a redesign.

### "Can you add a feature?"

> "I can. That would be $[X] one-time or $[Y] added to your monthly. Want me to scope it out?"

### "It's broken!" (It's not)

Often user error. Walk them through on a call. Don't charge if it's a real bug. Do charge if they forgot their password.

### "My cousin will take over"

Two options:
1. Train the cousin (charge for training session)
2. Hand over access and wish them luck (kill the monthly, done)

## Maintenance Tasks

What you actually do on a monthly basis:

### Included in Monthly Fee

- Keep it running (hosting)
- Fix bugs when they appear
- Answer questions
- Minor text/image changes

### Occasional Tasks

- Update dependencies (quarterly)
- Security patches (as needed)
- Database cleanup (if it grows)

### Time Reality

A stable Micro-SaaS for one client takes **1-2 hours/month** average. Most months: zero. Some months: a few hours.

This is why the monthly fee is profitable.

## When Things Go Wrong

### Outage

1. Acknowledge immediately (even if you can't fix yet)
2. Diagnose
3. Fix and deploy
4. Explain what happened (briefly, no excuses)
5. If it was your fault, offer credit on next invoice

### Client Unhappy

1. Listen
2. Ask what would make it right
3. Do it if reasonable
4. If unreasonable, hold your boundary professionally

### Client Wants to Cancel

1. Ask why
2. If fixable, offer to fix it
3. If not, let them go gracefully
4. Provide data export if they need it
5. Turn off access after current billing period

## Keeping the Relationship

Monthly tools create ongoing relationships. Maintain them:

- **Check-in quarterly**: "How's the booking system working?"
- **Proactive updates**: If you improve something, tell them
- **Upsell gently**: "I noticed you're doing X manually. I could automate that for $Y."

Good Micro-SaaS clients become long-term revenue. Treat them well.

## Exit Strategy

What if you want to stop maintaining?

### Option 1: Sell the Client

Find another developer to take over. Transfer:
- Codebase
- Hosting access
- Client relationship
- Monthly revenue

### Option 2: Make It Self-Sufficient

- Document everything
- Give client full access
- Reduce to "break/fix only" support
- Lower monthly fee

### Option 3: Sunset It

Give 90 days notice. Help them transition to alternative. Export their data.

## Summary

The Micro-SaaS model works because:
1. You already have the client (no marketing)
2. You've seen their pain (no guessing)
3. You build tiny (stays profitable)
4. Monthly revenue compounds (passive-ish income)

Do it right, and 10 Micro-SaaS clients at $100/month = $1,000/month recurring with minimal effort.
